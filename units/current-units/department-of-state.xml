    <note>On September 15, 1789, an “act to provide for the safe-keeping of the Acts, Records, and
        Seal of the United States, and for other purposes” (1 Stat. 68) changed the name of the
        Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of State and assigned to it certain domestic
        duties, nearly all of which were later reassigned to other agencies.</note>
