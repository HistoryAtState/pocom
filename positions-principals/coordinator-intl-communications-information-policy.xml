            <p>On Nov 22, 1983, Congress, in the Department of State Authorization Act for Fiscal
                Years 1984 and 1985 (P.L. 98-164; 97 Stat. 1025), made the Coordinator for
                International Communications and Information Policy a Presidential appointee subject
                to the advice and consent of the Senate. The Department of State had established the
                position on Dec 29, 1981, and made the incumbent responsible to the Under Secretary
                of State for Security Assistance, Science, and Technology. The coordinator acquired
                a rank equivalent to an Assistant Secretary of State and the personal rank of
                Ambassador in Apr 15, 1983, and became head of a new Bureau of International
                Communications and Information Policy on Jun 4, 1985. This Bureau was incorporated
                into the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs under the Reorganization Plan of
                Feb 5, 1993. The merger took place May 12, 1994. Richard C. Beaird served as Acting
                Coordinator Feb 1993-May 1994.</p>
