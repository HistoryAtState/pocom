            <p>The Continental Congress voted on Jan 10, 1781, to establish a Department of Foreign
                Affairs; on Aug 10 of that year, it elected Robert R. Livingston as
                Secretary of Foreign Affairs. The Secretary’s duties involved corresponding with
                U.S. representatives abroad and with ministers of foreign powers. The Secretary was also charged with transmitting Congress’ instructions to U.S.
                agents abroad and was authorized to attend sessions of Congress. A further Act of
                Feb 22, 1782, allowed the Secretary to ask and respond to questions during sessions
                of the Continental Congress.</p>

            <note>Following the organization of the government under the Constitution, Mar 4, 1789,
                Jay continued in charge of foreign relations, informally supervising the Department
                of Foreign Affairs upon its creation, Jul 27, 1789, and the Department of State from
                the adoption of that name for the Department (effective Sep 15, 1789) until
                Jefferson took office as Secretary of State Mar 22, 1790. Jay had meanwhile (Sep 26,
                1789) been appointed Chief Justice.</note>
