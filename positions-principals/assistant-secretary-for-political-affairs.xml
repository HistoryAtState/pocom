            <p>The Department of State by administrative action established the position of
                Assistant Secretary for Political Affairs in 1947 to oversee the Departmentâ€™s four
                geographic offices. The incumbent assumed the duties previously exercised by the
                Assistant Secretary of State for European, Far Eastern, Near Eastern, and African
                Affairs and the Assistant Secretary of State for American Republic Affairs.</p>
            <p>The position was discontinued in 1949, when following an Act of Congress that
                increased the number of Assistant Secretaries of State from six to ten (May 26,
                1949; P.L. 81-73; 63 Stat. 111), the Department created separate geographic bureaus
                for European Affairs; Far Eastern Affairs; and Near Eastern, South Asian, and
                African Affairs; and reconstituted the Bureau of American Republic Affairs, each
                headed by an Assistant Secretary of State.</p>
